# Movie Rating Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for predicting movie ratings using machine learning.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict movie ratings based on various features such as user preferences, movie genre, director, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be obtained from various sources like [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) or [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/). The dataset includes the following files:
- `ratings.csv`: Contains user ratings for different movies.
- `movies.csv`: Contains movie information such as title and genre.
- `users.csv`: Contains user information.

## Features

The dataset includes the following features:
- `UserID`: Unique ID for each user
- `MovieID`: Unique ID for each movie
- `Rating`: Rating given by the user (typically from 1 to 5)
- `Timestamp`: Time of the rating
- `Title`: Title of the movie
- `Genres`: Genres of the movie
- `Age`: Age of the user
- `Gender`: Gender of the user
- `Occupation`: Occupation of the user
